# Training-Model-Evaluation-and-Selection
split datasets into training, cross validation, and test sets, includes bias/variance testing 

this repository provides two ipynb files that show model evaluation/selection aswell as variance/bias testing 

use the datasets as seen in the code

-for variance/bias, we address:

To fix a high bias problem, you can:

try adding polynomial features
try getting additional features
try decreasing the regularization parameter
To fix a high variance problem, you can:

try increasing the regularization parameter
try smaller sets of features
get more training examples


- for model evaluation/selection

split datasets into training, cross validation, and test sets
evaluate regression and classification models
add polynomial features to improve the performance of a linear regression model
compare several neural network architectures
